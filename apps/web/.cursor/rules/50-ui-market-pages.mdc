# UX requirements
- Market page shows:
  - Outcome cards (probability %, delta, sparkline)
  - Main chart (time series per outcome)
  - Influential posts tabs (Most Relevant / Latest)

# Critical: no internal leakage
- Do not show raw Grok fields, raw E_o evidence, or raw rule templates.
- “Why this moved” can be high-level using display labels only.

# Data loading
- Fetch market_state + snapshots server-side.
- Posts list paginated/infinite scroll.
- Optional realtime: subscribe to market_state changes via Supabase Realtime.

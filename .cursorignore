.cursorignore works like .gitignore and is additive; keep Cursor focused by excluding build artifacts + deps.

# Cursor Project Rules (MDC)
# Naming note: Cursor community guidance suggests .mdc files in .cursor/rules/ with lowercase + hyphens.
# Cursor - Community Forum
# Nested rules: you can place .cursor/rules inside apps/web/ and services/ingestion-worker/ etc; nested rules auto-attach when files in that directory are referenced.
